        <b>Sarah Martinez</b> was born and raised in New Mexico. She studied at <i> Anderson School of Management</i> at the University of New Mexico. <br><br>
        When she was young, her mom knew she could always find Sarah with one of the many animals she had as a child. 
        Sarah moved out and got her own place she decided to get a puppy. She quickly realized that she would need to either take this puppy to the groomer every 6 weeks or learn how to do it herself. 
        She found her love for grooming by practing on her own 4 Yorkshire Terriers.
